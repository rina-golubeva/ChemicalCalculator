# ChemicalCalculator
Python. Project 1

The window application "Chemical Calculator" 
is launched from any platform that supports the Python language.

2 functions are provided for the user: 
for calculating the molar mass of the injected substance and for balancing reactions.

The first function waits for the input of a substance, residue or element, 
and at the output the user receives his substance with the necessary indices 
and the calculated molar mass with an accuracy of 3 decimal places.

The second function expects at the input an equation written with the signs + and =, without spaces,
and at the output the user receives a transformed dictionary, 
where coefficients are compared to the substances of the equation.

The code of the application itself is contained in the file tkinter.py .
The chem.ico file is an application icon.
File interface.py - implementation of the interface.
